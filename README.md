# Model-for-image-classification-on-EuroSat-dataset

Keras framework is used to implement this model.As EuroSAT does not define a test set, I used a 90/10 split for train and test. In the EuroSAT paper the authors found that the best performing model is ResNet-50 among the ones they tried so I implemented pre-trained ResNet-50 for this problem.
